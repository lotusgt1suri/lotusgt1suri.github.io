              Stripes of all sizes, colors, and angles are at least as ubiquitous on the Web
              as in any other medium of visual design, from magazines to wallpaper.
              However, the workflow of implementing them is far from ideal. Usually, we
              would create a separate bitmap image and need an image editor every time
              we needed to make changes. Some might use SVG instead, but it’s still a
              separate file and the syntax is far from friendly. Wouldn’t it be awesome if
              we could create stripes directly in our CSS? You might be surprised to find
              that we actually can.
