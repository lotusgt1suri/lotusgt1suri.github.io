              <b>Q. 1 What is Fuel Sparer ?  </b><br>
              It is special electronic product that made up of electrolysis condenser.

              <b>Q. 2 How does Fuel Sparer help my car? What benefits I can earn from using it? </b><br>
              Help your car working at its optimum condition, designed to maintain a stable working voltage over all electronic circuits and devices in you car. When there is an extra sudden load on your vehicle, like acceleration or turning on air-condition, it will prevent that load drain away any current from another electronic circuit in your car and all electrical parts will be working at their optimum conditions. Even lady drivers can use this system to monitor car battery condition easily. Inference Reducer System (IRS) is incorporated to reduce noise interference in your car so eliminate unwanted electrical signal from one device to another. Now, most of new cars use a lot of electronic parts, and it is like human body, it has actuators (similar to our hand's automatic nerves) and reflectors (to our hand's moto nerves system), signal are caught by actuators (like knock sensor) send back to CPU and process, new data is sent back to reflector (like spark plug) to correct problems. Noise interference will affect the accuracy of your car CPU computer response, so IRS will filter all noise signals and offer a love-noise signal operating condition to allow more accurate signal transfer between actuator and reflector for better car performance.

              <b>Q. 3 How to install and use Fuel Sparer ?  </b><br>
              Using Fuel Sparer is as easy as reading ABC. Just plug the terminal Fuel Sparer into your car cigar-lighter socket and it will work right away.  
              </p>

              <p class="para">
              <b>Q.4  How long Fuel Sparer will last?  </b><br>
              Normally electronic circuit devices expected average life-span is 3 years, and so is our estimation for Fuel Sparer . Handling with extra care can prolong the life-span of Fuel Sparer up to 5 years. 
              </p>
              <br>
              <p class="para">
              <b>Q. 5 How long does start working after I first install? </b><br>
              By theory, in a few seconds, it will work on your car once you install Fuel Sparer . 
              </p>
              <br>
              <p class="para">
              <b>Q.6 When Fuel Sparer stops working, will it affect or damage my car? </b><br>
              No, it won't. Fuel Sparer is an add-on device that connected only to the car battery through cigar-lighter socket. So it will work like a body-guard to your car, and when it stop working, your car will get back to its original working condition and nothing is affected, but of course, you will loose the benefits from Fuel Sparer .

              <b>Q. 7 If I repeatedly remove and install Fuel Sparer from one car to another, will this action affect its function on my car?  </b><br>
              As long as you carefully plug and un-plug from your car. But our best advice is to keep the unit attach to only 1 car. As repeated action of removing Fuel Sparer may result in wear and tare of the connectors both inside your car and also in Fuel Sparer so if you think Fuel Sparer is a good item, you should use a few more units on your different cars instead of constantly removing it from one car to another, it may shorten the life-span of Fuel Sparer at your own risk.

              <b>Q. 8 If I stop using Fuel Sparer for a while and reuse it again, will it damage my car?  </b><br>
              No, it won't as it is the same as you stop using Fuel Sparer and your car will get back to its original unhealthy condition. You will regain its benefits once you install it again.

              <b>Q. 9 How Fuel Sparer will help on fuel saving?  </b><br>
              Our car fuel economy is very dependent on engine ignition. And ignition is very dependent on ignition voltage. All car mechanics or professionals know that ignition voltage is about 120000-140000 volts. We don't want to carry such a big coil in our car, so we use induction energy to generate this high voltage from our battery voltage (12V), so we get energy. But a dark side of it is, if there is a change of 0.1V in battery voltage, by a factoring of 1000 times in voltage step will results in 100V change of spark plug voltage. So it will affect engine combustion efficiency, mainly contribute to incomplete engine combustion. Incomplete combustion will result in wastage of fuel economy. Fuel Sparer main function is to stabilize your battery voltage, store and release energy when there is a change in electrical voltage hence maintain stable operating battery voltage and induced ignition voltage. As a results, excellent fuel saving from complete engine combustion.

              <b>Q.10 Will Fuel Sparer shorten my battery life?  </b><br>
              Maybe some of you will wonder if Fuel Sparer can store and drain energy from battery, it will use up more battery compare to when it is not installed. In fact, it is reverse condition, as Fuel Sparer is like a secondary battery in your car, so it will reduce your current battery load and make battery life longer. Also with its self diagnosis Battery Doctor System, now you can check your battery operating voltage easier than before. That is why we say Fuel Sparer only should prolong your battery life like a human having regular body check-up program. 
              </p>
              <br>
              <p class="para">
              <b>Q. 11 If I do not remove Fuel Sparer from my car when I turn off my car engine, will it affect my battery? </b><br>
              Fuel Sparer does need a minimal electrical energy to work, but so small that is insignificant compare to your battery capacity. So you need to unplug it from your car when your car is regularly in use. Some car has an automatic cut off electrical supply to the cigar-lighter socket when engine is off to make it safer. As a better advice, if you intend to park your car for weeks or months, you should disconnect the battery regardless if you are using Fuel Sparer or not, as other electrical devices in your car will drain energy from your battery and make your battery flat even faster as compare to Fuel Sparer .

              <p class="para">
              <b>Q.12 What differences between Fuel Sparer and other similar device in the market? </b><br>
              Fuel Sparer is unique with its 3 in 1 Systems for your car and it is originally designed and made in by Japan Company which using their experienced know how in car performance industry for many years. Japan will constantly upgrade their technology in company products and benefits the users. High grade electronic components are use in Fuel Sparer that is more heat & vibration resistance compare to other, can withstand all kind of weather and humid conditions to protect the circuit inside. And also it is first in the market that design for in-car cigar-lighter socket plug in use, unlike other products to need to install them inside the engine compartment. That means over exposure to extensive heat, chemical, outside world and vibration. You can imagine life-span of your Fuel Sparer that stays with you inside your car as compare to those install in engine compartment under extreme weather.
